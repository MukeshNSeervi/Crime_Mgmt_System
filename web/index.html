                            <p>The security forces in Kashmir today morning gunned down three Lashkar-e-Taiba militants in Magam area of north Kashmir's Handwara.
                                following this, Jammu and Kashmir DGP SP Vaid was quick to tweet a laudatory message, "Excellent work".
                                Three LeT terrorists all Pakistanis neutralised in Magam area of Handwara district in North Kashmir. Excellent work!

                            </header>
                            <p>For most of November, Delhi has been blanketed by dense smog. Doctors in the capital declared the crisis a public healthy emergency, while the chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, called it a “gas chamber.” Since the beginning of the month, average pollution levels in the city have exceeded 10 times the World Health Organization-recommended 24-hour levels. At its worst, pollution levels were nearly 40 times this number.

                                But pollution is not just a Delhi problem. Indian cities are consistently ranked among Asia’s most polluted, according to WHO. Per the WHO's 2016 database, 10 of the world's most polluted cities, in terms of fine particulate matter, are in India.</p>
